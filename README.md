# DecomposeDMDensityProfile

Python script to decompose the dark matter density profile and measure the inner dark matter density slope given a circular velocity curve, rotation curve of the stellar component, and (optionally) the rotation curves of the atomic and molecular gas components. 

This code was written by R. C. Levy (rlevy.astro@gmail.com) and is based on the method presented by Relatores et al. (2019b). This code will be published in Cooke, Levy, et al. (in prep). *All papers using this code should cite that paper.*
